            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="app-name">Decision Royale</p>
            <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: January 18, 2026</p>

            <p>Mikhail Nikitin ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Decision Royale mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> Decision Royale is designed to be completely private. We do not collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name, email address, or any other personal identifiers</li>
                <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
                <li>Location information</li>
                <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The app uses local storage (UserDefaults) solely to remember your in-app preferences such as sound settings, haptic feedback preferences, and animation settings. This data remains on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

            <h2>Device Permissions</h2>

            <p>Decision Royale does not require any device permissions. No camera, microphone, location, or photo library access is needed to use the app.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <p>Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use your data for any purpose. Your app preferences are stored locally on your device only to enhance your experience within the app.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

            <p><strong>We do not use any third-party services.</strong> Decision Royale does not integrate with analytics platforms, advertising networks, or any third-party SDKs that collect or transmit data.</p>

            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

            <p>All data is stored locally on your device using Apple's UserDefaults. No data is transmitted to external servers. We implement industry-standard iOS security practices to ensure your local data remains secure on your device.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>

            <p>Your app preferences are stored locally on your device and will remain until you uninstall the app or reset your settings within the app. Since no data is transmitted to our servers, we have no access to or control over your data once the app is installed.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>

            <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no data for us to provide, correct, or delete. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reset your app preferences at any time within the app settings</li>
                <li>Uninstall the app to remove all local data</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

            <p>Decision Royale is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information, there are no privacy concerns regarding children's use of this app.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" above.</p>
