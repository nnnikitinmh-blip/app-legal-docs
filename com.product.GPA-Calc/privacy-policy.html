            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, we do not have access to your information. The app uses your data solely to:</p>

            <p>All your data is stored securely on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. The data is protected by your device's built-in security features, including device passcode and encryption.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>

            <p>Your data remains on your device until you choose to delete it. You can delete individual courses, semesters, or uninstall the app to remove all data.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
